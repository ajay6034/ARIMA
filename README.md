# ARIMA-Project
Experiement on Seasonal Data 

## Project Summary: 
This project involves the implementation of an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for forecasting time series data. The dataset used in this analysis contains monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. The project aims to model and forecast the number of passengers over time using the ARIMA model.

# Key Steps in the Project:
### Data Loading and Exploration:

The dataset is loaded and the first few rows are inspected to understand its structure.
The dataset contains two columns: Month and Thousands of Passengers.

### Data Preprocessing:
Initial checks for missing values and data anomalies are performed.
The dataset is cleaned to ensure it is ready for modeling.

### Modeling:
The ARIMA model is chosen for its capability to handle non-stationary time series data.
The appropriate parameters for the ARIMA model (p, d, q) are selected based on the data's characteristics.

### Model Evaluation:
The model's performance is assessed using standard metrics and visualizations.
The fitted model is used to make predictions on future data points.

### Forecasting:
The model is applied to forecast future airline passenger numbers.
Results are visualized to illustrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the model.

## Tools and Technologies:
### Python Libraries:
numpy and pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib for data visualization.
statsmodels for implementing the ARIMA model.
